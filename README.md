# YOLOv8-Object-Detection
This repository demonstrates object detection using the YOLOv8 model for detecting persons and personal protective equipment (PPE) such as hard hats, gloves, masks, and more. The project covers both the conversion of PascalVOC annotations to YOLO format and the implementation of the YOLOv8 model for object detection.
